# 🚗 PoseGuard – Driver Unwanted Pose Detection and Feedback System

PoseGuard is a real-time AI-powered driver monitoring system that detects distracted or unsafe driver postures using computer vision and deep learning. It generates instant audio-visual alerts, captures incident screenshots, and logs them for admin review through a secure, role-based web portal.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🎯 Real-time driver pose detection using a trained CNN model.
- 🔊 Automated visual and audio alerts on detecting unsafe behavior.
- 🖼️ Incident screenshots saved with timestamps for review.
- 🧑‍💼 Role-based access with separate user and admin portals.
- 📊 Admin dashboard to view reports and monitoring insights.
- 🌐 Responsive frontend built with Tailwind CSS and Flask.
- 🔒 Secure authentication using hashed passwords.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

According to the **WHO**, distracted and drowsy driving causes nearly **25% of all road accidents**, resulting in over **1.3 million deaths per year**. PoseGuard aims to tackle this by offering a low-cost, real-time alerting system for transport and fleet operators to improve safety and accountability.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user logs into the system using secure credentials.
2. Upon login, the camera feed starts and the AI model begins analyzing poses.
3. If an unwanted pose (e.g., drowsiness, mobile use) is detected:
   - ⚠️ A warning sound is played.
   - 🖼️ A screenshot is saved with a timestamp.
   - 🗂️ The event is logged in the database.
4. Admins can log in to view all incidents in the **admin portal** and **reports** section.
