        <p class="mt-6 text-lg neon-paragraph">
            Driver Unwanted Pose Detection System is designed to monitor driver
            behaviour in real-time, detect distractions, and provide instant alerts to
            prevent accidents.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 neon-paragraph">
            This system leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to
            analyse live video feeds, classify driver activities, and detect unwanted
            poses indicative of distraction. When a driver is found engaging in unsafe
            behaviour, the system issues real-time warnings and transmits feedback
            to the transport facility owner or service provider for further action.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 neon-paragraph">
            The project integrates various AI-powered modules, including image
            preprocessing, real-time video processing, distraction detection, alert
            generation, and remote reporting. By deploying this solution in cabs,
            transport services, and fleet management systems, organizations can
            enhance driver accountability, passenger safety, and operational
            efficiency.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 neon-paragraph">
            This project aims to create a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective
            solution to minimize accidents, promote responsible driving, and contribute
            to safer roads.
